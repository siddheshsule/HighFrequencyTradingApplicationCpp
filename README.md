# High-Frequency Trading (HFT) Application in C++

## Introduction
A basic HFT application written in C++ encompassing core components such as market data handling, order management, trading strategy implementation, and risk management.

## Project Structure
- **MarketDataHandler**: Handles incoming market data updates.
- **OrderManagementSystem**: Manages orders, including sending and canceling orders.
- **TradingStrategy**: Contains the logic for when to buy or sell based on market data.
- **Main Application**: Simulates market data updates and integrates all components.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++11 or later
- C++ Compiler (g++, clang++, MSVC, etc.)
- CMake (optional, for building the project)

### Building the Project

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hft-trading-app.git
    cd hft-trading-app
    ```

2. **Compile the project**
    - Using g++:
      ```sh
      g++ -std=c++11 -pthread main.cpp -o hft_trading_app
      ```

    - Using CMake:
      ```sh
      mkdir build
      cd build
      cmake ..
      make
      ```

3. **Run the application**
    ```sh
    ./hft_trading_app
    ```

## Key Considerations
- **Concurrency**: Proper synchronization (mutexes) is used to handle concurrent access to shared data.
- **Performance**: This example is not optimized for low-latency processing, which is critical for real-world HFT applications.
- **Risk Management**: Basic example lacks comprehensive risk management.
- **Regulations**: Ensure compliance with financial regulations when developing and deploying HFT systems.
